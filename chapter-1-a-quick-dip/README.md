# A Quick Dip

Chapter One is really broken down into 2 sections. "How it Works" and "Code Structure in Java"
are the main 2 sections of this chapter. In "How it Works" it goes over the flow of writing and running Java files and a little bit of the history of Java. "Code Structure in Java" goes over some of the syntax,anatomy of a class, and some datatypes that are commonly used.

## Questions and Answers

- What is a Compiler?

The Compiler checks for errors and won't let you compile until it is satisfied with your code. The compiler also creates a new document coded into java bytecode. Compile your code using javac (the compiler application)

- What is the anatomy of a class?

The anatomy of a class is structured in a few main pieces. Public class. Class. Name of the class. Name of the method. The arguments for the method if any. Every statement must end in a semicolon. See Below.

    public class ThisClass{
    	public static void main(String[] args){
    		System.out.print("This is Java!");
    	}
    }

- Do you have to declare the value type of every variable?

  Yes,you declare a variable unlike other languages.

- How does java written code actually work?

Create a source document that you can write your code in. When done or to a certain point compile the code and run it through a JVM(Virtual Java Machine).

- What is the syntax like in java?

The syntax is a lot like javascript and python once you get inside the class and the main.
